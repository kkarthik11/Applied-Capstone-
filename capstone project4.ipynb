This helps in making proper, smart and efficient decision on selecting good neighborhood out of other neighborhoods that are present in Scarborough, Toranto.\n\nThere are a lot of people immigrating to Canada and they require to find good neighbourhood and also affordable houses and good educational institutes for education. This project helps in finding all these along with the ease of access to the facilities like grorcery shops, medical store, hospital, parks and restaurants along with better community for living etc.\n\nThis Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nThis helps them with a better knowledge about the whole area and can find the required details about all the neighbourhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Problems identified</he>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "This project objective is to help find the people with better neighbourhood, along with the neighbourhood with good community and ease of acces to essential needs like grorcery shops, school, market and transport facilities.\n\n1.To sort the list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order.\n2.To sort the list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2>Location</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside.
